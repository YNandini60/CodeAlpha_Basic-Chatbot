# CodeAlpha_Basic-Chatbot
This Python chatbot, developed for CodeAlpha Internship Task 4, is a simple rule-based assistant that responds to greetings, questions about time and date, tells jokes, and introduces itself. It demonstrates if-elif-else logic, loops, functions, input/output, and basic automation.

#  Simple Chatbot
**CodeAlpha Internship ‚Äì Task 4**

##  Introduction
This project is developed as part of the **CodeAlpha Internship (Task 4)**.  
The chatbot is a **rule-based Python program** that interacts with the user via console input. It responds to greetings, tells the current time and date, shares random programming jokes, and introduces itself when asked. The program runs in a loop until the user types "bye".  

This project demonstrates basic Python concepts including **conditional statements, loops, functions, input/output handling, and randomization**.

##  Objective
The main goal of this task is to:
- Simulate a basic conversation with the user.
- Provide responses to common inputs like greetings, time/date requests, and jokes.
- Automate simple interactions in a fun and educational way.

##  Features
- Responds to greetings: `"hello"`, `"hi"`, `"hey"`.  
- Answers about **current time** and **current date**.  
- Tells **random programming jokes**.  
- Introduces itself when asked its **name**.  
- Friendly fallback response for unknown inputs.  
- Runs in a loop until user types `"bye"`.

##  Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **if-elif-else statements**
- **Functions**
- **Loops**
- **Input/Output**
- **datetime module**
- **random module**

##  How to Run
1. Save the script as `chatbot.py`.  
2. Open terminal or command prompt in the project folder.  
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

4. Type messages like `"hello"`, `"how are you"`, `"time"`, `"date"`, `"joke"`, or `"bye"` to interact with the chatbot.

## üìñ Example Run

```
ü§ñ Simple Chatbot (CodeAlpha Task 4)
Type 'bye' to exit.

You: hello
Bot: Hello there! üëã

You: what‚Äôs the time
Bot: The current time is 14:36:12 ‚è∞

You: tell me a joke
Bot: Why don‚Äôt programmers like nature? Too many bugs! 

You: what's your name
Bot: I'm ChatBot ü§ñ.

You: bye
Bot: Goodbye! üëã Have a wonderful day!
```

##  Learning Outcomes

* Writing a **rule-based chatbot** in Python.
* Using **if-elif-else statements** for decision-making.
* Implementing **loops and functions** for repeated tasks.
* Handling **user input/output** in console applications.
* Using **datetime and random modules** for dynamic responses.
